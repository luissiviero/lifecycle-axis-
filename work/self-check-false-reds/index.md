title: The self-check fails on an empty pointer and misreads approvals on a shallow clone
description: check_artifact_chain.py ends verify.sh with FAIL when .sdlc/active is empty -- now the common case, because a delegated merge with an empty queue clears the pointer -- and on a shallow clone attributes every approval to the grafted boundary commit; the same advance also leaves work/<slug>/index.md and work/index.md stale, so main is red on three counts that are not the work.
