title: Reduce GitHub minutes, waiting time and wasted tokens; keep the crucial procedures, loosen the rest
description: "The repository ran 1,124 workflow runs in six days on a private repo, exhausted the account's 2,000 free Actions minutes on 2026-09-08 21:43 UTC, and has been unable to run a single job since, including the owner's approval tap; most of those minutes, and the tokens and waiting behind them, went to work nobody used: superseded runs, a duplicate eval job, and a six-minute model triage of failures that were not the pull request's own."

# Reduce GitHub minutes, waiting time and wasted tokens; keep the crucial procedures, loosen the rest

- [intent.md](intent.md) — status: approved; approved-by: luissiviero; The repository ran 1,124 workflow runs in six days on a private repo, exhausted the account's 2,000 free Actions minutes on 2026-09-08 21:43 UTC, and has been unable to run a single job since, including the owner's approval tap; most of those minutes, and the tokens and waiting behind them, went to work nobody used: superseded runs, a duplicate eval job, and a six-minute model triage of failures that were not the pull request's own.
- [spec.md](spec.md) — status: approved; approved-by: luissiviero; Two pull requests: the control plane (draft-skipping gate, label-gated triage, per-PR concurrency, nightly-only evals, two-workflow merge wake, the skipped-run rule and the not-delegated verdict in the merge script) and the agent side (draft-first skills, one code PR at a time, the actions_minutes_per_pr measure with its band, the crucial-versus-loosened decision record).
- [plan.md](plan.md) — status: approved; approved-by: luissiviero; Two pull requests on one branch: the control plane (gate, review, evals and merge workflows plus the two merge-script rules) then the agent side (draft-first skills, the rule line, the actions_minutes_per_pr measure and its band, the decision record, the handoff).

Last gate: - 2026-09-11T19:35:00Z | PR #71 | draft -> in-review | claude | 4f60f76 | PR-A ready for the owner after four review rounds: conformance sonnet, security sonnet, M2 revision fable, plus the automated reviewer once the gate runs. Owner acts: create the triage label, read the four workflow diffs and apply control-plane-approved, optionally create branch protection requiring sdlc-gate and never agent-evals, then merge. Writer opus, reviewers sonnet, revision fable
